### Package Consolidation Task
1. Created tracking files in .ai directory
2. Analyzed current package structure:
   - packages/ui
   - packages/types
   - packages/utils
   - packages/eslint-config
   - packages/typescript-config

3. Created consolidated package.json:
   - Combined all dependencies
   - Set up proper exports for each subpackage
   - Maintained all necessary scripts
   - Preserved UI-specific configurations

4. Created new package structure:
   - Created src directory with ui, types, and utils subdirectories
   - Moved source files from individual packages
   - Created tsconfig.json with proper path aliases
   - Created tsup.config.ts for build configuration
   - Created main index.ts for re-exports

5. Restructured to shared folder:
   - Created new shared directory at root level
   - Moved consolidated package to shared/
   - Updated tsconfig.json with @shared aliases
   - Updated package.json with new name and structure

6. Set up index files and cleaned up:
   - Created index files for all subdirectories
   - Updated root tsconfig.json with @shared paths
   - Cleaned up old packages from packages/
   - Set up proper ESM imports

### Current Issues
1. Import path issues in index files:
   - Need to fix remaining ESM import extensions
   - Need to ensure all files are properly moved and accessible

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining import path issues
2. Test the build process
3. Update import paths in all files
4. Test imports in apps folder
